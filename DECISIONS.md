# DECISIONS

Design-decision and dependency-license log for Audio Claudio
(see `CLAUDE.md` §1 rules 2 and 7). Cornelius owns design decisions; each is
recorded here before it is implemented. The pinned stack in `CLAUDE.md` §3
governs until a step's *Design decision* is resolved below.

## NuGet dependency licenses

Every dependency SHALL be permissively licensed (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, MPL-2.0);
no copyleft anywhere in the graph (§1 rule 7).

## Design decisions

**Step 2 — frame delivery model: pull** (`IEnumerable<Frame> Frames { get; }`).
Consumer-driven; clean for files/tests (`source.Frames.ToList()`); no threads,
no callbacks, deterministic ordering by construction. The live mic (Step 10)
bridges the device callback into this via a bounded `Channel<Frame>` rather
than the port being pushed to directly. Resolved by Cornelius 2026-07-07.

**Step 2 — PCM quantisation convention** (implementation note, not a design
fork): the WAV writer/reader pair is made an exact inverse pair on the
quantisation grid rather than approximately equal. Writer: `q = round(x *
2^(bits-1))`, clamped to the signed range (`2^15` for 16-bit, `2^23` for
24-bit); reader: `x' = q / 2^(bits-1)`. Because both sides share the same
scale and rounding rule, `read(write(x')) == x'` bit-for-bit for any
already-quantised `x'`, which is what makes the round-trip tests exact rather
than tolerance-based.

**Step 3 — FFT: hand-rolled radix-2** (`Radix2Fft` in `AudioClaudio.Domain`),
dependency-free. Zero dependencies; keeps `AudioClaudio.Domain` strictly
BCL-only (R0.2); full `double` precision. Correctness is guarded by two
independent checks: Parseval's theorem (time/frequency energy conservation)
and a bin-by-bin cross-check against a naive O(N²) direct DFT reference
(computed only in the test project, never shipped). Alternative rejected:
NWaves (MIT) — deferred; if adopted for Phase 2 resampling, its adapter goes
in `AudioClaudio.Infrastructure`, never Domain, per R0.2. No new NuGet
package, so no license row above. Resolved by Cornelius 2026-07-07.

## Tooling substitutions (Step 0 wrinkles)

Two SDK-behavior surprises surfaced while scaffolding on .NET 10 SDK
(10.0.301); both are mechanical substitutions with no effect on the plan's
requirements or contracts, recorded here per the plan's own convention for
documenting such wrinkles.

- **Solution file format.** `dotnet new sln` defaults to the new XML-based
  `.slnx` format on this SDK (`dotnet new sln -h` shows `--format` defaults to
  `slnx`), not the classic `.sln` the plan and `RepoPaths.FindRepoRoot` expect.
  Regenerated explicitly with `dotnet new sln -n AudioClaudio -f sln` to produce
  the classic `AudioClaudio.sln`, matching the plan's literal paths and the
  `RepoPaths` repo-root locator (CONTRACTS.md §0) unchanged.
- **Test runner.** `dotnet new xunit` on this SDK scaffolded the classic
  xUnit + `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` (VSTest) runner, *not* the
  Microsoft.Testing.Platform runner — so the constitution's
  `dotnet test --filter Category=Fast` works as written, with no runner
  substitution needed.
